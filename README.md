# leaf-disease-classifier
This repository contains a complete deep learning pipeline for classifying plant leaf diseases using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented) and supports prediction on individual images after training.
